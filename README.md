### Framework of smart houses  
[Research]

Recently, the phrase ”Smart Houses” has gained popularity, and these homes are the product of technical advancement and contemporary technology. Smart houses are equipped with various automated systems that can be controlled remotely, such as lighting, heating, and security. Additionally, they often include features such as voice-activated assistants and energy-efficient appliances with required security to make daily life more convenient and environmentally
friendly. This research will analyse the smart house and the framework needed to live a personalized life. Conducting the theory of smart houses and discussing its impacts on the modern society. The research will illustrate the analysis of smart house components and which advantages and disadvantages cover the aspects or our framework. Moreover, discussing the agitation of future of smart houses. A research report has been used in this study to take a qualitative approach. The survey was used to collect data. The results indicate that the majority are familiar with the concept of smart houses and agree on the future of smart houses. The prospect for smart homes to fundamentally alter the way we live and interact with our houses is enormous as technology evolves. It is obvious that smart technology will keep playing a big role in influencing how our houses and everyday lives develop in the future.

### Monte Carlo Method & Synchronous Computations
[Monte Carlo Method & Synchronous Computations](https://github.com/learner-sys/Monte-Carlo-Method-Synchronous-Computations)

This project aim to use Parallel and Distributed Computing methods. The Monte Carlo Method is used to estimate the value of pi by estimating the number of darts hitting a circle with a radius of 1 unit. The program is then used to solve a problem with a number of tosses = 100,000, with different number of processes (2- 8 processes).The Synchronous Computations, A metal plate with 100 degrees of heat applied on each side has a 40-degree initial temperature. A program simulates temperature changes over 1000 cycles, partitioning the matrix based on rows. The program uses openMP with different threads (2-8) and different loop scheduling strategies.

### Designing a Scalable and Reliable Attendance Management System.
[Smart Attendance System ](https://github.com/learner-sys/Smart-Attendance-System)

The project aims to design and document an architecture for "Smart Attendance", a company that provides smart solutions to educational institutions. The system will be a highly reliable, scalable, and efficient attendance management system that uses AWS services for image processing, face recognition, and data storage. The system will use cameras in classrooms to capture images every 5 minutes, which will be processed for face recognition in the cloud. The attendance data will be stored in a database and accessible to instructors and students through a web page. The project will also include detailed cost estimation, and guidelines for fault-tolerant, highly available, scalable systems.

### Online Car Rental System

## Senoir Project (PHISHING EMAIL DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING)
[Research]

Phishing email is a fraud approach that many victims fall to in our digital era, such emails are designed to appear as legal sources and trap users making them give their personal and sensitive information. The infrastructure of a phishing email look equally as legitimate email but is likely to contain active links or embedded attachments to ask the user to verify, update, or renew their account, password, or any financialor personal confidential information. Phishing emails have a significant impact on our modern time, causing tremendous financial loss to uncountable victims. Hence, there is a dire need for anti-phishing solutions. This research encompasses the study of six different classification algorithms on English and Arabic datasets that will use divergent sets of features extracted from the email message and subject that will classify phishing emails from legitimate emails. Furthermore, this study compares the efficiency of the four sets of features on both datasets Arabic and English using SVM, Naïve Bayes, Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN classification algorithms. The results were promising, SVM attained 96% accuracy on the English dataset using ‘all features’ set, thus Random forest and Decision tree outperformed obtaining 96% accuracy on the Arabic dataset using ‘all features’ set. Altough, it was observed that one module performed great in the English dataset, but two models performed great in Arabic dataset.
