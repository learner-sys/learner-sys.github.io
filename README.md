Users can register themselves using a unique email and password, and AJAX is used to verify email and password. Users can browse open and ended polls, while public guests only able to browse all polls. Users can create new polls with titles, questions, and options, and end polls by clicking the STOP button or scheduling a end date and vote.

### Framework of smart houses  
Research

Recently, the phrase ”Smart Houses” has gained popularity, and these homes are the product of technical advancement and contemporary technology. Smart houses are equipped with various automated systems that can be controlled remotely, such as lighting, heating, and security. Additionally, they often include features such as voice-activated assistants and energy-efficient appliances with required security to make daily life more convenient and environmentally friendly. This research will analyse the smart house and the framework needed to live a personalized life. Conducting the theory of smart houses and discussing its impacts on the modern society. The research will illustrate the analysis of smart house components and which advantages and disadvantages cover the aspects or our framework. Moreover, discussing the agitation of future of smart houses. A research report has been used in this study to take a qualitative approach. The survey was used to collect data. The results indicate that the majority are familiar with the concept of smart houses and agree on the future of smart houses. The prospect for smart homes to fundamentally alter the way we live and interact with our houses is enormous as technology evolves. It is obvious that smart technology will keep playing a big role in influencing how our houses and everyday lives develop in the future.

### Monte Carlo Method & Synchronous Computations
[Monte Carlo Method & Synchronous Computations](https://github.com/learner-sys/Monte-Carlo-Method-Synchronous-Computations)

This project aim to use Parallel and Distributed Computing methods. The Monte Carlo Method is used to estimate the value of pi by estimating the number of darts hitting a circle with a radius of 1 unit. The program is then used to solve a problem with a number of tosses = 100,000, with different number of processes (2- 8 processes). The Synchronous Computations, A metal plate with 100 degrees of heat applied on each side has a 40-degree initial temperature. A program simulates temperature changes over 1000 cycles, partitioning the matrix based on rows. The program uses openMP with different threads (2-8) and different loop scheduling strategies.

### Designing a Scalable and Reliable Attendance Management System.
[Smart Attendance System ](https://github.com/learner-sys/Smart-Attendance-System)

The project aims to design and document an architecture for "Smart Attendance" using AWS, a company that provides smart solutions to educational institutions. The system will be a highly reliable, scalable, and efficient attendance management system that uses AWS services for image processing, face recognition, and data storage. The system will use cameras in classrooms to capture images every 5 minutes, which will be processed for face recognition in the cloud. The attendance data will be stored in a database and accessible to instructors and students through a web page. The project will also include detailed cost estimation, and guidelines for fault-tolerant, highly available, scalable systems.

### Online Car Rental System 
[Online car rental system ](https://github.com/learner-sys/Online-car-rental-system-)

## Senoir Project (Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing)
Research

In today's interconnected digital world, cyberattacks pose a significant risk to data integrity and online confidentiality, often using phishing emails, leading to financial losses and psychological issues to users. Phishing email includes an active link or file (picture, statement, or invoice). The email appears to come from a legitimate source, such as a friend, company, or bank. That tricks the victim into giving out personal information. This research encompasses the anti-phishing solutions. Therefore, looks into the structure of the Phishing Emails, define and study the features that help to classify phishing emails from legitimate emails, in English and Arabic datasets. Advanced techniques were used as Natural Language Processing for reading the emails. And Machine Learning Classification Algorithms for emails classification. In a nutshell, the study proposed a systematic method for email classification. Introduced new features and defined the best Machine Learning Models for both English emails and Arabic Emails. Using research findings, we can develop a real-world application in future research; and use more advanced techniques of NLP and ML for more optimal email classification.
